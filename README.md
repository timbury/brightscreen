# brightscreen
Check and control LCD screen brightness values from the command line.

brightscreen.sh

This script is meant to provide a way to regulate brightness of LCDs from
the command line. It is being developed on a Lenovo IdeaPad Y50-70 Touch,
the display of which is controllable via /sys/class/backlight/.

The current and maximum brightness levels can be checked by any user but
root privileges are required to change the level. Run with sudo as necessary. 

YMMV
